## Hi there 👋

I'm Tetsuma Sato, based in Japan.

Weekend programmer and typing enthusiast.

I mainly work with web technologies. Recently, I've been writing a lot of MoonBit.

### Writing

I write articles on Zenn and my personal blog.

I wrote a tech doujinshi (self-published technical book) for Techbookfest.

### Typing Tools

Lately, I've been building typing-related tools!

- [typinglabs/haduki-layout](https://github.com/typinglabs/haduki-layout) - Haduki layout: a computed kana layout for sequential keystrokes
- [typinglabs/datore-well](https://github.com/typinglabs/datore-well) - Practice words from typing trainers!
- [typinglabs/romaji_typing.mbt](https://github.com/typinglabs/romaji_typing.mbt) - Input validation library for romaji typing
- [typinglabs/japanese-layout-analyzer](https://github.com/typinglabs/japanese-layout-analyzer) - Analyze, evaluate, and try Japanese sequential keystroke layouts

Programming is fun! Not even AI can take that away!
